## Introduction

In convolutional neural network, we involve two parts: feature extraction and classification. In feature extraction there are convolutional layers and pooling layers, classification, on the other hand, includes the fully connected layer. Sometimes, we use a technique called transfer learning, it means that we are going to replace the final classification layer and reuse the existing trained model. 

With this technique, our model benefits from the feature extraction training that was performed on the based model. In this article, we will see how to implement transfer learning for a classification model using TensorFlow.

## 1. Installing and Importing libraries

First we need to install the TensorFlow libraries that we are going to use:
```python
!pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

Import TensorFlow libraries that we will use:

```python
import tensorflow
from  tensorflow import keras
print('TensorFlow version:',tensorflow.__version__)
print('Keras version:',keras.__version__)
```

Libraries are imported, TensorFlow version is 2.4.1 and the keras version is 2.4.0.

## 2. Model and data preparation

To use transfer learning, we need a base model from which we can use the trained feature extraction layers. The resnet model is an CNN-based image classifier that has been pre-trained using a huge dataset of 3-color channel images of 224x224 pixels. Let's create an instance of it with some pretrained weights, excluding its final (top) prediction layer.

```python
base_model = keras.applications.resnet.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224,224,3))
print(base_model.summary())
```

It took a few seconds:

Now let's prepare the image data, we need data loaders for color images that are 224x224 pixels in size. 

Define the data generators and list the classes for our images:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

data_folder = 'data/shapes'
pretrained_size = (224,224)
batch_size = 30

print("Getting Data...")
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, # normalize pixel values
                             validation_split=0.3) # hold back 30% of the images for validation

print("Preparing training dataset...")
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    data_folder,
    target_size=pretrained_size, # resize to match model expected input
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='training') # set as training data

print("Preparing validation dataset...")
validation_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    data_folder,
    target_size=pretrained_size, # resize to match model expected input
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='validation') # set as validation data

classnames = list(train_generator.class_indices.keys())
print("class names: ", classnames)
```

## 3. Modeling

We downloaded the complete resnet model excluding its final prediction layer, so need to combine these layers with a fully-connected (dense) layer that takes the flattened outputs from the feature extraction layers and generates a prediction for each of our image classes.

We also need to freeze the feature extraction layers to retain the trained weights. T

```python
from tensorflow.keras import applications
from tensorflow.keras import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense

# Freeze the already-trained layers in the base model
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Create prediction layer for classification of our images
x = base_model.output
x = Flatten()(x)
prediction_layer = Dense(len(classnames), activation='softmax')(x) 
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=prediction_layer)

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Now print the full model, which will include the layers of the base model plus the dense layer we added
print(model.summary())
```

Now train the model. With the layers of the CNN defined, we are ready to train it using our image data. 

```python
# Train the model over 3 epochs
num_epochs = 3
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch = train_generator.samples // batch_size,
    validation_data = validation_generator, 
    validation_steps = validation_generator.samples // batch_size,
    epochs = num_epochs)
```

View the loss history:
```python
%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

epoch_nums = range(1,num_epochs+1)
training_loss = history.history["loss"]
validation_loss = history.history["val_loss"]
plt.plot(epoch_nums, training_loss)
plt.plot(epoch_nums, validation_loss)
plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.ylabel('loss')
plt.legend(['training', 'validation'], loc='upper right')
plt.show()
```
We can see the final accuracy based on the test data, but typically we'll want to explore performance metrics in a little more depth.

Let's evaluate the model performance:

```python
# Tensorflow doesn't have a built-in confusion matrix metric, so we'll use SciKit-Learn
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

print("Generating predictions from validation data...")
# Get the image and label arrays for the first batch of validation data
x_test = validation_generator[0][0]
y_test = validation_generator[0][1]

# Use the model to predict the class
class_probabilities = model.predict(x_test)

# The model returns a probability value for each class
# The one with the highest probability is the predicted class
predictions = np.argmax(class_probabilities, axis=1)

# The actual labels are hot encoded (e.g. [0 1 0], so get the one with the value 1
true_labels = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)

# Plot the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predictions)
plt.imshow(cm, interpolation="nearest", cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.colorbar()
tick_marks = np.arange(len(classnames))
plt.xticks(tick_marks, classnames, rotation=85)
plt.yticks(tick_marks, classnames)
plt.xlabel("Predicted Shape")
plt.ylabel("Actual Shape")
plt.show()
```

Use the trained model for predicting the class of an image:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import models
import numpy as np
from random import randint
import os
%matplotlib inline

# Function to predict the class of an image
def predict_image(classifier, image):
    from tensorflow import convert_to_tensor
    # The model expects a batch of images as input, so we'll create an array of 1 image
    imgfeatures = img.reshape(1, img.shape[0], img.shape[1], img.shape[2])

    # We need to format the input to match the training data
    # The generator loaded the values as floating point numbers
    # and normalized the pixel values, so...
    imgfeatures = imgfeatures.astype('float32')
    imgfeatures /= 255
    
    # Use the model to predict the image class
    class_probabilities = classifier.predict(imgfeatures)
    
    # Find the class predictions with the highest predicted probability
    index = int(np.argmax(class_probabilities, axis=1)[0])
    return index

# Function to create a random image (of a square, circle, or triangle)
def create_image (size, shape):
    from random import randint
    import numpy as np
    from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
    
    xy1 = randint(10,40)
    xy2 = randint(60,100)
    col = (randint(0,200), randint(0,200), randint(0,200))

    img = Image.new("RGB", size, (255, 255, 255))
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    
    if shape == 'circle':
        draw.ellipse([(xy1,xy1), (xy2,xy2)], fill=col)
    elif shape == 'triangle':
        draw.polygon([(xy1,xy1), (xy2,xy2), (xy2,xy1)], fill=col)
    else: # square
        draw.rectangle([(xy1,xy1), (xy2,xy2)], fill=col)
    del draw
    
    return np.array(img)

# Create a random test image
classnames = os.listdir(os.path.join('data', 'shapes'))
classnames.sort()
img = create_image ((224,224), classnames[randint(0, len(classnames)-1)])
plt.axis('off')
plt.imshow(img)

# Use the classifier to predict the class
class_idx = predict_image(model, img)
print (classnames[class_idx])
```
